# s&box modding tools
s&box modding tools is a fork of the S&box game engine to add modding tools for users such as mod management, patching core functionality through MonoMod.RuntimeDetour and more.

Planned features:
- Loading WASM (with Wasmtime) allowing mods to be written in (almost) any language along side normal .NET assemblies
- Hot reloading through the built in editor API (and custom functionality for Web Assembly).
- Custom asset loading
- Custom mod-managed mouting points for assets from other games to be used. (I.E. other source engine games)

Note that any of these features may be dropped due to viability and/or difficulty for my skillset. Feel free to contribute your own changes, additions, and enhancements!

# s&box

s&box is a modern game engine, built on Valve's Source 2 and the latest .NET technology, it provides a modern intuitive editor for creating games.

If your goal is to create games using s&box, please start with the [getting started guide](https://sbox.game/dev/doc/about/getting-started/first-steps/).
This repository is for building the engine from source for those who want to contribute to the development of the engine.

## Getting the Engine

### Steam

You can download and install the s&box editor directly from [Steam](https://sbox.game/give-me-that).

### Compiling from Source

If you want to build from source, this repository includes all the necessary files to compile the engine yourself.

#### Prerequisites
